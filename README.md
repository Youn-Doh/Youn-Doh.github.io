# Youn-Doh

My name is Youn, a software developer with a background of over 8 years of hands-on experience in retail and operations management. 

I decided to make a transition to the tech industry during Covid lockdown as I discovered a passion for creativity, problem-solving, and embracing challenges. I recently completed a bootcamp course where I gained valuable experience collaborating with others and enhancing my skills. 

I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented individual, consistently delivering high-quality work. I excel in both cross-functional teamwork and independent tasks, maintaining focus and dedication throughout.

Please check out my other repositories as I am building some interesting things!

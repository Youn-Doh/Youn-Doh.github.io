    <h3>Emotional Intelligence Exploration</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</em><br>
      </br>
      I learned about myself - First, I wasn't that patient with myself which I always thought myself was a patient person. I get frustrated easily, and I could not get over it. Once I got really stressed out and almost got bombed out. 
      Secondly, I found myself I don't like speaking up in front of the crowd. I knew this already, but I was even worse than I thought, I definitely had some moments I had to ask for help but I was spending more time struggling than suggested time. 
      Lastly, actually I am not too sure what was the new thing about me. The first part was very shocking to me but there was nothing new that I learned about myself.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
      <li><em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em><br>
      </br>
      The roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming are knowing yourself you can challenge and have a faith in you and others.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em><br>
    </br>
    There were some facts that surprised me, even though I already knew some stuff but it is just really surprising about realising how much you can stretch and how much you can grow. I also really want to see myself growing too.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em><br>
    </br>
    I enjoyed most of core learning, but most challenging aspect was when we had to train some parts of mindfulness and talking about being spiritual. I am not a religious person, however this activity was feeling somehow it is similar to things that you will do in some religious group.
    </li>
  </br>
  </br>
  <li><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em><br>
  </br>
  I strongly agree that we need to train ourselves not just technically but also need to learn about core. As I have some working experience, when you are working in a team you need to cooperate with other people, and that is actually the hardest part than technical or physical work. All of us need to learn how to deal with other co workers, and not just someone being nasty at me but also remind myself not being nasty to other people too.
  </li>
</br>
</br>
<li><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em><br>
</br>
I do not think it is a waste that spending a lot of time on core learning, but most of the time I was feeling overwhelmed by the actual coding work so I could not focus on core learning much. If I have an opportunity, I would spend more time on training myself with core learning.

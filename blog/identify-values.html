    <h3>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li><em>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </em><br>
      </br>
      I always have my ethics in my mind, and believe I am doing the right things. For a simple example, I made a decision to buy free-range eggs even they are a bit more expensive. But I thought chickens being cage-free is more valuable then I can save $1~2. I can reflect this decision that it is a very small thing I can do for the environment but surely it has values just by the action.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
      <li><em>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</em><br>
      </br>
      In general, being an Asian girl from far east Asia, I always have been moralistic and respectful of others. Also I would say I am quite conservative, which I tend to avoid a dangerous situation or some risks. I would not put myself in a risk if I know that is going to be not right.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</em><br>
    </br>
    I would say I am a very genuine person. I would not fake myself to anyone. I would come upfront when things are not right. Also I like to analyse and think about logics. That would be a big strength to think as a programmer when I am on problem solving.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</em><br>
    </br>
    As I said before, I would be hated if I am in unstable or being in a risk. That would be my limit, but I understand as I work with other people there will be some difficult situation. I need to overcome and try to upfront with difficulties.
  </br>
  </br>
    <li><em>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</em><br>
    </br>
    With my previous work, I started with working with online orders and warehouse management. After few weeks of working, I came up with much better idea with organisation for the warehouse - faster to find right stock, easy to look and put items back etc. However when I shared my ideas it was not easy to make that happen as people were working with that way for really long time and they did not want to change the system. Eventually we kept having meetings and discussion and I could demonstrate the convenience and everyone agreed that was the better system. <br>
    From this, I learnt correct way of communication. A lot of people don't like changes, so communication is important and I should be confident and show them it is going to work better.

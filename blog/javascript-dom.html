    <h3>JavaScript Fundamentals</h3>
    
    <p>
      <em><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></em><br>
    </br>
      JavaScript is a tool that you can make HTML and CSS in action. For example, like Harry Potter movie, JavaScript is like a wizard with a wand who can make the feather fly by itself.
    </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>`control flow` and `loops`</strong></em><br>
    </br>
      To be honest, I don't have a full understand with control flow and loops just yet, and I am still learning. However as far as I have learnt, The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. And `loop` is something the computer will go repetitively, just like running on treadmill.
    </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>What is 'DOM'</strong></em><br>
    </br>
      DOM is Document Object Model. It is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. There is a DOM Tree, so evert HTML tag is an object. You can hook HTML tags to JavaScript, using ids or classes. When you see such thing like `getElementById`, `getElementsByName` etc, these are the methods of DOM you can use in JavaScript.

    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>What is difference between `arrays` and `objects`?</strong></em><br>
      </br>
      Arrays are like a tray that you can have multiple items, Objects are consists of `key` and `value`. For example, when you go shopping, array can be used as your shopping list.<br>
      `const shoppingList = [
      "eggs",
      "cabbage",
      "oat milk",
      "bread"
      ]
    </br>
      Then for `object` will be like this:
      `const groceryShopping = {
        place: "Clevedon Farmer's Market",
        Date: "16th of July"
        time: 10.30
      }  
    </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>What is `functions`?</strong></em><br>
    </br>
      `functions` are a method designed for a task. It is consists of function name, parameters, arguments and values. `return` is very helpful when you want an outcome from function.

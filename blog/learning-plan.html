    <h3>Formulate Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>Here are short Q&As I have answered.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em><br>
      </br>
        I want to be able to work in more flexibility with time and either in office or working remotely additionally fair amount of salary. With my previous job, I did not have any choice, even with the state of the emergency I had to be in the office, and there was no personal review or salary review therefore not so much challenge for myself. It is now week 3 of learning codes so I would not say I know a lot, but as I learn through programming I would decide if I want to be a software developer.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
      <li><em>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</em><br>
      </br>
      My limitation is lack of questioning myself, or sometimes other people. However I am slowly overcoming this limit as I am going through my course as 'flipped learning'. I am trying to get used to with finding paths for my learning and search online when I have questions, and asking colleagues for help if I get really stuck. Also I think my biggest strength is patience. I can stay calm even when I am stuck or frustrated with myself or other people. 
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em><br>
    </br>
    I want to develop myself with communication skills and risk taking skills. It also relates my learning limitation as mentioned above, I am not so fluent with asking questions. Also my personality is not the type of risk taking adventurer, I would have not been to many changes. However I am building myself with flipped learning, and also taking this course itself is a huge change for me, so I hope to see there are more skills to come!
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</em><br>
    </br>
      <ul>
        <li><em>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</em><br>
      </br>
      I will always stick to my work ethic. Also I want to share my knowledge and thoughts with open minded attitude. <br></li>
    </br>
    <li><em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</em><br>
    </br>
    This actually happened already during this course, so what I have done is first I will look up on google or some other search engine. If I cannot find answer, I will ask my close friends who have experience with codes, then if I cannot still solve the problem I will ask my co-students and facilitators. 
    </li>
    </ul>
  </br>
  </br>
    <li><em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</em><br>
    </br>
    I am also trying to get used to work with time box. For this course, suggested weekly hours are 40 hours, so I am trying to work as suggested ideally 8 hours per day. When we switch to bootcamp, I have plans for working 10 hours everyday for 6 days in a week.
  </li>
  </br>
  </br>
  <li><em>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</em><br>
  </br>
  I am expecting the Facilitator team to be our guides and being friendly and attentive.
  </li>
</br>
</br>
<li><em>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</em><br>
</br>
I do not have any specific commitment at the moment, but sometimes I am committed to my other groups of hobbies. I think I will be planning getting back onto these, as I think these time will be good for me eventually managing my pressure and stress.<br>
</li>

    <h3>About Neuroplasticity</h3>
    
    <img src="https://scientificscarsdalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Neuroplasticity.png">

    <ul>
      <li><em>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</em><br>
      </br>
      Neuroplasticity can help people to overcome their limit and motivate they can do more. Rather than knowing your limit and give up on something when you are in challenging situation. It is true that your brain will change shape and can build more muscles and cells as you train and learn, so there are infinite possibilities human can make.   
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
      <li><em>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</em><br>
      </br>
      Like myself, I had lots of struggles last week learning JavaScript. Every concepts are new, that I am not familiar with, and I had to keep moving forward to learn more new stuff when I am already struggling. And now at this timing, learning about neuroplasticity is great, as I felt stupid last week, but now I can say I have done lots of exercise with my brain.  
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</em><br>
    </br>
    Repeatedly practice an activity, or even just using imagination will increase your neuroplasticity.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</em><br>
    </br>
    The article and the diagram in this link helps to see the concepts easily with nice illustrations and related explanations:<br>

    <h3>About Growth Mindset</h3>
    <li><em>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</em><br>
    </br>
    Growth Mindset is how to think you can achieve, and you can accomplish without thinking you are going to fail. With people who have growth mindset will have more opportunities to develop your abilities.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</em><br>
    </br>
    Nothing particularly surprised me, but it is always amazing the capabilities what you can achieve with your mindset. Hopefully this will change me to think not in negative ways.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em><br>
    </br>
    I will start thinking as 'not yet' rather than why can't I do it. Sometimes I will get into a loop with negative mind, but now I will try to think with I can achieve better.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</em><br>
    </br>
    https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset<br>
    </br>
    This link is useful as it gives lots of examples how I can train a growth mindset. With 'How to develop a growth mindset' paragraph, I could see what I have done in my past life and I used to say those 'fixed mindset' inner voice, so now I know instead of that what I should say.
    </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
    <li>After having research I realised I have been thinking a lot as a fixed mindset. Now I know what my brain can do, I will think as I can always achieve my goal, and think positively. </li>

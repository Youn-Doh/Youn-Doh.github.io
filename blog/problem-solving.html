    <h3>Problems Problems Problems...</h3>

      <li><em>How did I face a problem with JavaScript?</em><br>
      </br>
      I had a feeling of that I am on the right track but couldn't figure out where the error was coming from. And almost every steps were problems, spent hours to figure out the right answer. Then I tried to solve problems with mostly google, then asking peers, then if I still couldn't figure out I did check on discord for other students' questions. I was very stressful and struggling. And after going through those processes I am hoping that I learnt some codes and how to find right codes for right situation.

    </br>
      <li><em>Reflect on how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</em><br>
      </br>
      The easiest problem-solving process is trying something. I could write some codes then Console.logging and see what my codes are printed. Then googling lots of different codes, and look for questions and answers that someone already had similar problem previously. Still if I could not find the right track, I would reach out to my peers then coaches for more guides. But I felt like I couldn't solve problems by myself with almost single problems, so felt quite pathetic about asking my peers.
      </li>
    </br>
    </br>
    <li><em>Reflect on a time I was reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made me reluctant to do so. What might I try differently next time?</em><br>
    </br>
    With the first problem, I could find answer by myself, but straight after that those exercises were really diffficult for me. First it did not take long to reach out but by the time I move to the next problem I hesitated a lot to reach out to other peers. It was worse because by the time I get behind, and with almost every exercise I could not find answers by myself.

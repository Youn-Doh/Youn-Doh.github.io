      <h3>Hello</h3>
      <em>Welcome</em> to my blog!<br />
      Feel free to look around my learning progress.
    </p>
  
    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>
      My name is Youn. <br />
      I moved to Auckland when I was 12, before that I lived in Seoul, Korea.
      <br />
      <br />
      I briefly tried free coding course during lockdown (real brief like 2
      hours), as my previous job I could not work remotely, so I just stayed
      home mostly just sleeping and cooking (I enjoyed though). But I thought I
      wanted to do something more, and just sitting in a comfort zone was not
      me. So I already made a decision to leave my job during 2020 lockdown
      where I worked for 6 years, and mid last year, decided to do a course at
      Dev Academy where I can think about my future more and challenge myself.
      <br />
      <br />
      I have lots of hobbies I can probably list like 30.. haha! I will share
      few things, I love travelling, I have been to 19 countries, I am a huge
      enthusiast for craft beer and coffee! Also I play in music bands. And I am
      a foodie and I like cooking too. <br></p>
      <p>Here is a picture of myself from the recent trip! <br>
